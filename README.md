# Amazon Recommendation Scraper

This is command-line scraper for Amazon's product recommendations, generating 
network files that can be used to find patterns, 'rabbit holes' and so on in
Amazon's recommendations.

This is far from the first code written to do this, but Amazon makes scraping 
quite difficult, no longer offering APIs and not making naive request-based
scraping easy either.

This script uses [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) via Python to use an
actual browser to go to the Amazon page, and then extracts the recommendations
found on the page. This approach has drawbacks: it's slow and 
resource-intensive. Scraping takes 10-30 seconds per item with this approach.
But it works, for now.

## Install
To use the scripts you need to install 
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and a compatible 
[geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/latest). There 
are many guides out there on how to do the latter (e.g. these for 
[macOS](https://gist.github.com/cgoldberg/4097efbfeb40adf698a7d05e75e0ff51) or 
[Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56926716)).

After you've done that, download the scraper scripts (e.g. by cloning this git 
repository locally) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the 
required libraries (if `pip` does not work, try `pip3`).

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, simply invoke the script from the command
line:

```
python scrape.py -i seeds.txt
```

This assumes you have a file `seeds.txt` that contains Amazon product page 
URLs - one per line - which the recommendations will be scraped for. The results 
will be saved in GDF files you can open with a network analysis application such
as [Gephi](https://gephi.org).

There are other command-line parameters too:

```
python scrape.py --input seeds.txt --depth 1 --prefix /results/
```

Try `python scrape.py --help` for a full list. Be very careful with the 
`--depth` parameter: the amount of items that will be scraped increases 
extremely quickly if you set this to something greater than 0.

## A few notes on the data

The GDF files are generated per recommendation type. If you have used Amazon, 
you may have noticed that it provides many recommendations: 'customers also 
bought', 'customers also *viewed*', 'other 4 star items', and so on. These are
saved as separate networks, so you will get one network generated with the
'customers also bought' recommendations found on each scraped page, and so on.

Note that these recommendations are generated by going to Amazon with a 
browser. When you start scraping, the browser always starts with a blank slate.
Nevertheless, Amazon may notice requests from e.g. the same IP address and use
the pages that you scrape as input for their recommendations. Some of the
recommendations ('recommended for you') explicitly do so. Remember this when
analysing the data!
